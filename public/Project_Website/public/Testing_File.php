        <p class="card-text">African Wild West is a collection of lush and immersive ambiences recorded in Senegal over the course of a 3-week trip in 2017. The library consists of 70 recordings totaling more than 6 hours, available both as stereo and surround. The recordings have been captured with a Sennheiser Double Mid-Side rig both at all times of day and night in the following locations:

        Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary, an immense wetland teeming with wildlife
        savanna areas in Northern, Eastern and Central Senegal
        desert oases at Desert de Lompoul, Western Senegal
        arid forests in Central Senegal
        tropical forests in Niokolo-Koba National Park, South Eastern Senegal
        the banks of the river Gambia
        mangrove forests in the Saloum Delta, on the Atlantic coast
